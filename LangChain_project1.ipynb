      "\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mThis Python function `get_first_n_primes` will return the first \"n\" prime numbers, where \"n\" is the input parameter passed to the function. The function makes use of another helper function `is_prime` to check if a given number is a prime number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The `is_prime` function takes a number `num` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` if it is not. It first checks if the number is less than 2 (since prime numbers start from 2). If the number is less than 2, it returns `False`.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. The function then iterates over numbers from 2 up to the square root of the number (`int(num**0.5) + 1`) checking if the number is divisible by any number in that range. If the number is divisible by any other number (i.e., has factors other than 1 and itself), it returns `False`, indicating that it is not prime. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. The `get_first_n_primes` function initializes an empty list called `primes` to store the prime numbers found. It also sets the variable `num` to start from 2, as 2 is the first prime number.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. The function then enters a loop that continues until the length of the `primes` list is less than the input parameter `n`. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of `num` is a prime number by calling the `is_prime` function. If it is prime, the number is appended to the `primes` list.\n",
      "   \n",
      "5. The `num` is then incremented by 1, and the loop continues until `n` prime numbers are found and added to the `primes` list.\n",
      "   \n",
      "6. Finally, the function returns the list of the first \"n\" prime numbers that were found.\n",
      "   \n",
      "7. You can adjust the value of the variable `n` at the end of the script to determine how many prime numbers you want to generate. In this case, it is set to 10 (`n = 10`), so calling `get_first_n_primes(n)` will return the first 10 prime numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this function, you can easily generate the first \"n\" prime numbers in Python by providing the desired value of `n`.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Nvidia Corporation (, en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.\n",
      "Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads the market for discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet) and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.\n",
      "In addition to GPU design and manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).\n",
      "Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and the company's valuation has skyrocketed since then as the company became a leader in data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom. In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.\n",
